# CO₂ Emissions Analysis (2012-2022)
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of CO₂ emissions in the United States from 2012 to 2022. Using data from various sectors and fuel types, it visualizes key insights through interactive and static plots. The analysis is aimed at understanding trends, sector-wise contributions, and geographical distributions of emissions.
## Features
1. Data Fetching:
    - Retrieves CO₂ emissions data from an external API based on year, sector, and fuel type.

2. Data Processing:
    - Cleans and aggregates the raw data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Summarizes data structure, identifies trends, and detects anomalies.

4. Visualizations:
    - Line plots, pie charts, stacked bar charts, strip plots, and an animated choropleth map.
